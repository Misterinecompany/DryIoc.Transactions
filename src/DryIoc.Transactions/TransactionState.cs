	/// called on the Transaction. If, for example, a <see cref="DependentTransaction"/>
	/// has Rollback() called on it, the parent transaction has no way of getting
	/// deterministically notified, so its state will still be active, until
	/// Commit() is called on it (or <see cref="ITransaction"/>.Complete() in the case of the API);
	/// then <see cref="TransactionAbortedException"/> will be thrown.
